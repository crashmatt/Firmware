/**

 *
 * Mixer ioctl interfaces.
 *
 * Normal workflow is:
 *
 * - open mixer device
 * - add mixer(s)
 * loop:
 *  - mix actuators to array
 *
 * Each client has its own configuration.
 *
 * When mixing, outputs are produced by mixers in the order they are
 * added.  A simple mixer produces one output; a multirotor mixer will
 * produce several outputs, etc.
